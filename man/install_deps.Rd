\title{Install dependencies of project corresponding to feature}
\usage{
install_deps(
  project = ".",
  feature = NULL,
  local_repos = get_local_pkgs_from_config(),
  direction = "upstream",
  install_project = TRUE,
  dry_install = FALSE,
  verbose = 0,
  install_external_deps = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{(\code{character}) directory of project (for which to restore the
dependencies according to feature); must be a git repository.}

\item{feature}{(\code{character}) feature we want to build; inferred from the
branch of the project if not provided; warning if not consistent with
current branch of project}

\item{local_repos}{(\code{data.frame}) repositories that should be taken from
local rather than cloned; columns are \verb{repo, host, directory}}

\item{direction}{(\code{character}) direction in which to discover packages
either or both of "upstream" and "downstream"
to recursively checkout upstream and/or downstream dependencies}

\item{install_project}{(\code{logical}) whether to also install the current
package (\code{project})}

\item{dry_install}{(\code{logical}) dry run that lists packages that would be
installed without installing; this still checks out the git repos to
match \code{feature}}

\item{verbose}{(\code{numeric}) verbosity level, incremental;
(0: None, 1: packages that get installed + high-level git operations,
2: includes git checkout infos)}

\item{install_external_deps}{logical to describe whether to install
external dependencies of package using \code{remotes::install_deps}.}

\item{...}{Additional args passed to \verb{remotes::install_deps. Note }upgrade`
is set to "never" and shouldn't be passed into this function.}
}
\value{
installed packages in installation order
}
\description{
This reads the dependencies for the project (recursively) and
installs the right branches based on the feature.
The dependencies can be upstream (by default) and downstream (to
install downstream packages as well).
}
\details{
It throws a warning if the currently checked out branch in the project
is not the one that would be taken based on \code{feature}.
The checked out branch should be a local branch.
